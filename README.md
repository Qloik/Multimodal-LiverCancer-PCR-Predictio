## Background

Neoadjuvant therapy for liver cancer aims to reduce tumor size before surgery. However, treatment effectiveness varies among patients. This project develops an AI-powered prediction system to help evaluate treatment efficacy using medical imaging and clinical data.

## Project Overview

A deep learning approach to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for liver cancer patients using:
* Multi-sequence MRI images from multiple timepoints
* Clinical blood test data (tumor markers)
* Deep neural networks for medical image analysis

## Technical Approach

### Data Processing
* Multi-modal data integration from:
   * Multi-sequence MRI scans (multiple timepoints)
   * Clinical blood test results
   * Treatment outcome labels
* Medical image preprocessing pipeline
* Feature extraction from time-series medical data

### Model Architecture
* Deep learning framework for multi-timepoint MRI analysis
* Multi-modal data fusion strategies
* Classification network for treatment outcome prediction:
   * Class 0: Complete necrosis
   * Class 1: Stable disease
   * Class 2: Tumor progression

### Training & Evaluation
* Training on single-hospital dataset
* Validation metrics for medical prediction tasks
* Model performance analysis on real clinical cases

## Dataset

The training dataset includes:
* Longitudinal MRI scans from multiple treatment timepoints
* Clinical blood test records
* Physician-annotated treatment outcomes
